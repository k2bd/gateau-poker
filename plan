server stars, hosts a game

I can POST game config info over web to control starting stack, start the game early, etc.

player registers to the game (POST /reg) with player info (Display name, IP address & port), server returns an ingame ID (counts up from 0) and a secret UUID for validation

game starts, server POSTs turn order, initial button position, etc to all players.
POSTs small blind info to all players
POSTs big blind info to all players

UTG player POSTs the move they want to make

Game server interprets move into a legal move (e.g. under-bet --> min-bet, illegal check --> fold)
POSTs interpreted move info to all players
